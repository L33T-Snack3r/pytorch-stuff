"Approved Disability
Hello Everyone 👋

I finally got approved for disability. The process took me 1 year in total and I was approved on the first try.

I have tried over 40 medications 💊 with 10 different doctors and 5-7 different hospitals/clinics.

Just want to say, it’s possible for chronic migraines. Keep pushing and track EVERYTHING. I had a thick packet and finally it paid off.

Thank you to everyone in this sub that has kept me afloat and hopeful, really helped.

Cheers, Silver 🐶 🐾",0,irrelevant
"ARTICLE: Neurologists reveal 15 subtle migraine symptoms — that aren’t a headache
I ran across this article about migraines and how neurologists are starting to rethink some some longstanding beliefs. I was particularly glad to see the comment ""this is a complex brain disorder, and it's not just a headache,"" which addresses how migraines are frequently dismissed by friends, family, and employers who are as ""just a headache."" I've always considered migraines as a neurological condition.

The article lists a number of things that might be a sign that a migraine is developing, some which have traditionally been considered as triggers which cause a migraine. The list includes
Food cravings, especially for sweet or salty foods, and neck stiffness, aching or pain. The article states:

""While some of these behaviors, particularly cravings, were once thought of exclusively as migraine triggers, ""there's a movement to shift away from thinking about triggers,"" Singh explains. ""We're reframing that and wondering if it's actually part of this prodrome phase of migraine."" Essentially, it's not that eating chocolate triggered your migraine attack and, instead, experts are starting to think the craving for chocolate might be part of the first phase of migraine.""

Here's the whole article:

"What's your migraine remedy?
I'm on my 3rd day of a migraine. :( I can't skip classes though so I've been walking around with sunglasses this whole time.

Do you lovely ladies have any tips for dealing with migraines? I'm really stuck. I've never had one before this and I think it's even delayed my period since I'm so stressed out.

update: I had some coffee and it feels like the caffeine helps, or at least is providing a much needed placebo. They don't sell excedrin migraine in Canada (in case anyone is wondering) thank you everyone for your responses <3",1,relevant

"Has anyone actually cured their migraines?
Hi there. I get around 2 migraines a month. I can usually manage them by taking Ibuprofen Lysine (over the counter) and resting before the pain gets too bad. They then usually subside gradually over 24- 48 hours. The worst ones are where I am required to be somewhere, like a family gathering/work commitment and cannot rest, then the pain gets passed what i call the 'point of no return'. Once I go passed this point I get blurry vision and vomiting and the pain is like my head is being squeezed in a vice - IYKYK

Anyways my sympathy to anyone who gets them worse than me, I know a lot of people do.

Has anyone actually cured their migraines? I am willing to try anything (within reason!).

Here is what I think causes my migraines:

Alcohol (pretty much tea total now), excess caffeine, excess sugar, excess background noise, too much screen use, stress.

I try and eat a clean whole food diet 90% of the time, exercise cardio and resistance daily, get plenty of sleep. All I am sure help.

I have a 3 to 4 a day coffee addiction. Maybe I should cut this down?

Someone else recommended cranial massage/manipulation?

Thanks in advance.",1,relevant

"Beyond angry and upset
I had recurrent UTI’s from 2019-2021 that were very painful and aggressive, every 6 weeks at the most I’d get one. I had to drop out of school for a bit and then I had to almost quit my job.

I was doing lab results and never had them communicated to me. I have had recurrent UTI’s since then but it’s gotten easier.

I finally found a doctor who listens to me and extracted all the former lab work and went through it with me and told me my UTI’s have been caused by a very aggressive bacteria called klebselia pneumonie. I’m spelling it wrong lol. But after all these years of being told my UTI’s weren’t a big deal, I find out it actually is more aggressive and real than I thought.

I’m on a treatment plan right now but for everyone who feels like giving up or feels stuck

Don’t stop asking questions Don’t stop seeking more info Don’t stop advocating for yourself Don’t listen to the docs who think you’re making this up

Its not anxiety It’s not stress It’s not in your head

"Chronic UTI has made me ( 29 F) suicidal.
Suicidal from chronic UTI. Want it to end. Don’t see any hope for recovery. Been suffering from chronic UTI symptoms for three and a half years now. The current culture tests don’t show anything. Doctors think it’s psychological. Can’t work, travel or exercise. Can’t have sex. Can’t eat or drink anything because my bladder reacts to almost everything. I’m peeing frequently. Drinking too much water triggers it. Drinking too less water triggers it. In an emotionally distressing relationship. Staying triggers my UTI symptoms, trying to leave the relationship triggers my UTI symptoms. Bf seems to have had enough. Antibiotics , D-mannose, herbal remedies , cranberry, diet modifications. Have tried all forms of medications. Nothing has worked so far. Confined to my bedroom so that I can stay close to my bathroom. Even pelvic therapy triggers it more. Feeling helpless and lost.

"Lower back pain. What's stronger than ibuprofen?
TLDR
Taking Ibuprofen for lower back pain. Doesnt work too well. What's a stronger OTC med? Or will I have to get a prescription med?

\

M/48yo

On March 5th I was making the bed. Was leaning over to tuck the sheet under the mattress and BANG came the sudden lower back spasm.

Hurts like hell now. Agony to get out of bed (takes me 30 minutes).

Once I'm up I can shuffle walk, tiny steps. Can't bend.

I'm taking Ibuprofen. 1 x 400mg capsule/8 hrs.

It does help but the stabbing red hot poker pain that comes when I turn in bed or sit down/get up from a chair is still there.

Is ibuprofen the strongest OTC med I can get. If I go to a doc what is likely to be prescribed to knock more pain away?

Also - is the pain going a hang around for months? How long do these sprain type episodes take to go away? Lying down is torture. If I could sleep standing up I would.

Thx for any info.",1,relevant
"Back pain leading to depression and overeating
I’ve been dealing with back pain for over 5 years. I’ve always enjoyed working out but during flare ups that’s not possible. I’ve done a lot of PT but still hasn’t solved it.

I’m an emotional eater so use that to cope, but it probably continues to make it worse since sugar triggers inflammation. But it’s the only thing that mentally makes me feel better. just don’t really care any more, it’s frustrating.

Anyone with similar experiences, and if so how did you overcome it? Thank you",0,irrelevant

"I had my first migraine since giving birth with my LO last week and it was awful. He's only 10 weeks so he's pretty attached to me all day.

We spent most of the day playing in bed so I could lie down, and we had a bath just to break up the day. I was really lucky he wasn't super fussy that day and only needed one little walk around in the sling to calm down.

What really helped was that before my husband started work he put everything I would need in arms reach of the bed. I EBF so that was covered, but he made sure nappies, toys, food etc were all there. Then when he finished work he took over right away.",0,irrelevant

I went to the urgent care and was given meds for the stomach pain. But because my heart rate is a bit high and because of my symptoms they recommended I go to the ER if I get worse.

"AITA for taking a sick day for period cramps
I woke up in the morning with horrific period cramps. I always get them the worst on the first day of the period, and then they get better as it goes. It also always starts at 2am. So i woke up at 2am with cramps, knew my period was coming, went and put a pad on and got back into bed. Usually putting a pad on makes the cramps less severe, i think its probably a mental thing but it works. However, this time it didnt. They were so bad that i couldnt get to sleep. And they werent just the achey cramps, they were the sharp ones that feel like getting stabbed in the vagina every time you move. I was awake the entire night, even on painkillers. My alarm went off at 7:30 and i was exhausted. I got up for a shower and my insides felt like they were being squeezed super hard. I just dropped back down onto my bed, grabbed my phone and called in sick to work. They asked the reason and i was honest. I said i had horrific cramps and the person on the phone went ""oh. Right... okay"" and put me down as sick.

Half way through the day the cramps eased enough to get out of bed and i went to the shop to get some more pads as i was running low. At the shop i saw my coworker buying lunch. He raised his eyebrows at me and shook his head. I even held up my packet of pads to show him i was there for a valid reason. But he didnt say anything and left to go back to work.

This evening i have been berated by my boss for missing work for a non valid reason and that if i was well enough to go to the shops, i was well enough to go into work. So obviously my coworker ""snitched""

So are period cramps not a valid reason? If i had a stomach ache they would let me stay home. Am i seriously an asshole for staying home?",0,irrelevant
"10 hours of sleep
So i finally went to the dr. for my migraine. Cause its been really bad for a long time and 1-2 times a week so bad, where i can barely keep it together. This week i decided to go to bed at like 7:45pm every night. So i ended up sleeping around 10 hours every night this week and today around 11 hours. I noticed that for the first time in forever, i haven’t gotten a headache or anything for a week. Im guessing its because i’ve been sleeping so much.. I usually tried to get around 8 - 8.5 hours of sleep, when i have work and that gives me migraines/headaches. Why is it, that i haven’t gotten any headaches this week, just because i slept around 10 hours every night. If this is the case. I cant go to bed at like 7:45pm every night..

"The other night, my wife (29F), son (13m) and I (30m) went to my parent’s house for dinner. While we were there, our son started to develop a headache. It was no big deal at first, they gave him some ibuprofen. About thirty minutes later though, he had his head buried in the couch begging us to go home because he was in too much pain. We decided to go home, and he curled up in the backseat of the car holding his head. When we got home, he refused to move, saying that lifting his head hurt too much and he felt dizzy when he did it. I carried him in and put him on his bed. When my wife and I started getting ready for bed, she rubbed his back and asked him to change for bed so he’d be more comfortable. He just mumbled before falling back asleep. We both tried a few more times before giving up and showering. When I finished, I just decided to undress him and cover him up. She walked in as I was doing it and snapped at me, she told me It was a massive invasion of his privacy and was totally wrong. I finished though and tucked him in. He hasn’t said anything about it to either of us, but my wife has been telling me to apologize to him for being invasive and weird. AITA?",0,irrelevant

Almost 1 year since my ruptured aneurysm. Its been a rocky road to say the least but i am extremely grateful to b a live. One down side is that my relationship with my immediate ppl i see have changed. They do not understand what it truly means to have low energy. My husband he surely cant understand why some days i can not go with him places. He thinks its very simple just get up walk to car n sit in it , whats so hard about that. Instead feel like they are forgetting i did not choose this, . Am i wrong for being upset that my 13th anniversary was yesterday and i did put together a small but meaningful gift to give him. He got me nothing not even a card he claims money is tight. He planned nothing because i never want to go anywhere or i may get a headache. I explained that he knew it was coming up he could have put a few dollars aside here n there for the last 30 days gotten me a card n write something to me n i would have loved it.
